### MVVM with linking (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Model: Holds application data patterns
- View: Displays a representation of the model and gets the user's interaction with the view (clicks, keyboard, gestures, etc.) and their processing is defined to link the view and view model to data binding (properties, event callbacks, etc.).
- ViewModel: Holds business logic that reveals common features and functions

### Simple Core Data is used.
